## Welcome to this page

Here a quick description of some of the things I have been doing while at FreeCodeCamp. This site is a temporary solution while working on a more customised project.

### How long and what I have been doing?

I joined FreeCodeCamp since 2015 as student in 2015 and in the same year I was invited to help with data analyses too. I keep supporting the group providing useful advices based on their data or external analyses, while keeping up my studies in web development.



For those analyses I have been using platform-specific tools as well as customised code by exploring existing API's.

- Currently also strengthening my knowledge in Recommender Systems

- MEAN full stack (mongoDB, Express, Angular and nodejs)
- d3.js and canvas

**Data Analysis Technologies and Tools**:

- python suites: pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc; also with relevant knowledge in R

- Some API's I have been recently using: Google youtube, Google Maps; facebook's graph; Discourse (forum platform); twitter; Gitter (chat platform); medium; meetup

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/evaristoc/freecodecamp_portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
