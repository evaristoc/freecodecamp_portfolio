## Welcome to this page

Here a quick description of some of the things I have been doing while at FreeCodeCamp. This site is a temporary solution while working on a more customised project.

### How long and what I have been doing?

I joined FreeCodeCamp since 2015 as student and by the end of that year I was invited to help with data analyses too. I was founder of the [FreeCodeCamp's Data Science Room](gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience), being still an active contributor.

At FreeCodeCamp I still support the Core Team members providing useful advices based mainly on FreeCodeCamp data but also external sources, while continuing my studies in web development.

For those analyses I have been using platform-specific tools as well as customised code by exploring existing API's.

The analyses I have done for FreeCodeCamp cover a wide range of platforms and topics, but most of them concentrate on the impact that FreeCodeCamp has on users as well as how to implement cost-effective solutions that extend the reach of that impact. Recently I have been **suggesting guidelines to improve the visibility of the content at FreeCodeCamp social media resources**, such as discourse (forum), medium and youtube, analysing data that could help their SEO. For some of the existing content in the forum my recommendations helped to quadruplicate the number of organic search viewers after small SEO changes. I have also done an analysis for medium titles and I am currently working on youtube videos. 

I report monthly over the status of the project platforms by looking at Google Analytics and other platform-specific dashboards.

I also publish now and then articles for [FreeCodeCamp at Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/).

During my time in FreeCodeCamp I have also been doing other analyses and activities such as:

- First time evaluation of [**factors affecting the reach of FreeCodeCamp**](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/english-size-connectivity-and-campsites-factors-driving-the-use-of-free-code-camp-worldwide-3c9d4e2b8c17)
- **Gitter chatrooms: characterization of its main social structure**; analysis of the activity of the users in those chatroom; previous examples of those analyses can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience)
- Several analyses evaluating [**curricular performance of FreeCodeCamp users**](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/algorithms-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-e63db0a9cfb3); this analyses have been relevant for the organization of the new FreeCodeCamp curriculum; an example can be found [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/89#issuecomment-269218703)
- Facebook: cross-sectional evaluation of the [**status of the City Groups**](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=577a579264638562096df040) (Facebook is by default the rendezvous of the FreeCodeCamp external groups, or City Groups)
- **New Developer Surveys**, [2016 Edition](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey) and 2017 Edition (in progress): coordinating the participants from the Data Science Room, providing feedback for their work at that room or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-), and suggesting or elaborating some charts
