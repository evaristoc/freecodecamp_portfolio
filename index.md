## Welcome to this page

Here a quick description of some of the things I have been doing while at FreeCodeCamp. This site is a temporary solution while working on a more customised project.

### How long and what I have been doing?

I joined FreeCodeCamp since 2015 as student and by the end of that year I was invited to help with data analyses too. I was founder of the [FreeCodeCamp's Data Science Room](gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience), being still an active contributor.

At FreeCodeCamp I still support the Core Team members providing useful advices based mainly on FreeCodeCamp data but also external sources, while continuing my studies in web development.

For those analyses I have been using platform-specific tools as well as customised code by exploring existing API's.

The analyses I have done for FreeCodeCamp cover a wide range of platforms and topics, but most of them concentrate on the impact that FreeCodeCamp has on users as well as how to implement cost-effective solutions that extend the reach of that impact. Recently I have been **suggesting guidelines to improve the visibility of the content at FreeCodeCamp social media resources**, such as discourse (forum), medium and youtube, analysing data that could help their SEO. For some of the existing content in the forum my recommendations helped to quadruplicate the number of organic search viewers after small SEO changes. I have also done an analysis for medium titles and I am currently working on youtube videos. 

I report monthly over the status of the project platforms by looking at Google Analytics and other platform-specific dashboards.

I also publish now and then articles for [FreeCodeCamp at Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/).

During my time in FreeCodeCamp I have also been doing other analyses and activities such as:

- First time evaluation of [**factors affecting the reach of FreeCodeCamp**](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/english-size-connectivity-and-campsites-factors-driving-the-use-of-free-code-camp-worldwide-3c9d4e2b8c17)
- **Gitter chatrooms: characterization of its main social structure**; analysis of the activity of the users in those chatroom; previous examples of those analyses can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience)
- Several analyses evaluating [**curricular performance of FreeCodeCamp users**](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/algorithms-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-e63db0a9cfb3); this analyses have been relevant for the organization of the new FreeCodeCamp curriculum; an example can be found [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/89#issuecomment-269218703)
- [**Analysis of reported NGO technological needs**](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=57c086602a7bd0e920538d45), which coincided with FreeCodeCamp's decision to develop its flag project, Code for Good
- Facebook: cross-sectional evaluation of the **status of the City Groups** (Facebook is by default the rendezvous of the FreeCodeCamp external groups, or City Groups)
- **New Developer Surveys**, [2016 Edition](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey) and 2017 Edition (in progress): coordinating the participants from the Data Science Room, providing feedback for their work at that room or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-), and suggesting or elaborating some charts
- **Organised analytical projects in the FreeCodeCamp's Data Science Room**, some of the results can be found summarised in [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/one-year-experience-in-the-free-code-camp-data-science-room-c97eb905af1f)
- Semi-automated procedure for **summarising posts in the FreeCodeCamp's Data Science Room** (currently on-hold); see [this post](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=571357f5548df1be102da00b) for an example
- Other analyses: estimations of attrition and retention of users; estimations of employability of FreeCodeCamp users 


### Main topics of interests?

- Online users and Online Behaviour Analysis; Online User Lifecycle
- Information Retrieval, Text Mining, Text Analytics and Social Network Analysis
- Social Media Analysis and Content Analysis
- Mobility; use of technology by far-to-reach, deprived segments
- SEO
- Because the domain FreeCodeCamp belongs, I have been also exploring the KPI's used in Learning Analytics
- Currently also strengthening my knowledge in Recommender Systems
- Data Mining (unsupervised, supervised); Machine Learning; Deep Learning

### Technologies of interest?

**Data Analysis Technologies and Tools**:

- python suites: pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc; also with relevant knowledge in R
- training in PyShark (Databricks)
- training in Cloudera technology (Hadoop, HBase, etc)
- Google Analytics, Youtube Analytics, Discourse Dashboard, Medium Dashboard, Google Trends and free tools to compare traffic
- Some API's I have been recently using: Google youtube, Google Maps; facebook's graph; Discourse (forum platform); twitter; Gitter (chat platform); medium; meetup
- exposure to other technologies such as selenium and elasticsearch

**Web Development Technologies**:

- MEAN full stack (mongoDB, Express, Angular (4) and nodejs)
- d3.js and canvas
- Javascript, Typescript

**Programming**

- preference for modular patterns to code in Javascript, nodejs and d3.js
- knowledge of object oriented programming and design patterns; basic functional programming; basic reactive programming; basic map-reduce

### Other Projects

**Studies**

- Apart of FreeCodeCamp training I keep permanently learning. Just to mention some, I am currently (2017) completing Specializations in Data Mining and Information Retrieval (University of Illinois/Coursera) and another in Recommender Systems (University of Minnesota/Coursera).
